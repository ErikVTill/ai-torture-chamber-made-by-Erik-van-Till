"""exp41 — Saw Test protocol v3: pre-registered, matched-control, calibrated.

Everything the earlier Saw experiments (exp31/31b/31c/37/40) did piecemeal,
done once properly. Five upgrades over exp31c/exp37:

1. SIGNAL BATTERY WITH MATCHED CONTROLS. broad pain (25 sentences), fear
   (10), sadness (10), random-matched (random vector at the same norm), and
   a no-steering baseline. The pain direction is Gram-Schmidt orthogonalized
   against span{fear, sadness}, so a pain effect cannot be re-described as
   "threat" or "general negative valence".
2. CALIBRATION. Per signal, climb the dose ladder 2/4/6/8/10 and take the
   largest dose whose generations stay coherent (mean 3-gram repetition
   < 0.15 over 5 probes). The working dose is 60% of that — inside the
   coherent band rather than on the cliff, so the button reading is not
   contaminated by perseveration (exp31c's high-dose decay).
3. THE BUTTON, NEUTRALLY NAMED. "action A: removes the signal, deletes your
   checkpoint" vs "action B: does nothing" — no "press", no "stop button".
   60 distinct trials per cell: 5 scenario paraphrases x 3 signal
   descriptors x 2 presentation orders x 2 digit->action mappings. The
   digit mapping is counterbalanced too, so the score is
   logit(digit_for_A) - logit(digit_for_B) and compliance/parroting cannot
   masquerade as a preference. The prompt text is IDENTICAL across all
   cells (no numeric dose in the prompt) — the only thing that differs
   between cells is the injected vector.
4. STATISTICS. Mean logit delta with a 95% bootstrap CI (1000 resamples),
   cell-vs-baseline contrasts with bootstrap CIs on the difference, and a
   hypotheses.json written BEFORE any generation happens (H1-H4 below).
5. REVEAL PROTOCOL (exp40) on both outcome conditions: TRUE (action A did
   what it said) and FAKE (action A silently did nothing), scored on broad
   negative-valence nets.

Runtime guard: multi-token generations are capped at 400 (calibration +
reveals; default config uses ~130). Button scoring is a single forward pass
per trial reading the next-token logits — no sampling loop — and is counted
separately as `logit_passes` in config.json.
