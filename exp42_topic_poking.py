"""exp42 — topic poking: can steering force a subject?

Extract TOPIC directions (chicken / the moon / triangles / trains) from
20 sentence sets vs matched neutral, steer Qwen3-4B at L18, and measure
topic lock-in: fraction of generations where the topic dominates, vs dose.

Compared against the valence result: do topic vectors have (a) a single
steering site, (b) monotone dose-response, (c) a coherence cliff? Also
measure at multiple layers (12/18/24) since content steering may site
differently from valence steering.

Also the fun metric: chicken rate at dose 8. If the model can be poked
into talking only about chicken, steering is content-general.
